### 2 Samuel 4:2-5:7

### David reigns over Israel. The capture of Jerusalem

Saul’s son Ish-boʹsheth had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baʹanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Be-erʹoth (for Be-erʹoth also is reckoned to Benjamin; the Be-erʹothites fled to Gittaʹim, and have been sojourners there to this day).

    Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreʹel; and his nurse took him up, and fled; and, as she fled in her haste, he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibʹosheth.

    Now the sons of Rimmon the Be-erʹothite, Rechab and Baʹanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-boʹsheth, as he was taking his noonday rest. And behold, the doorkeeper of the house had been cleaning wheat, but she grew drowsy and slept; so Rechab and Baʹanah his brother slipped in. When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him. They took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night, and brought the head of Ish-boʹsheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-boʹsheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; the Lord has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.” But David answered Rechab and Baʹanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Be-erʹothite, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity, when one told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and slew him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?” And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-boʹsheth, and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.

Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, “Behold, we are your bone and flesh. In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you that led out and brought in Israel; and the Lord said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.’” So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.

And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebʹusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, “You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off”—thinking, “David cannot come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
