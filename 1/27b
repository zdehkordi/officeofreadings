### Isaiah 30:1-18

### The uselessness of alliances with foreign peoples

“Woe to the rebellious children,” says the Lord,

    “who carry out a plan, but not mine;

and who make a league, but not of my spirit,

    that they may add sin to sin;

who set out to go down to Egypt,

    without asking for my counsel,

to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh,

    and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!

Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame,

    and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation.

For though his officials are at Zoʹan

    and his envoys reach Haʹnes,

every one comes to shame

    through a people that cannot profit them,

that brings neither help nor profit,

    but shame and disgrace.”

An oracle on the beasts of the Negeb.

Through a land of trouble and anguish,

    from where come the lioness and the lion,

    the viper and the flying serpent,

they carry their riches on the backs of asses,

    and their treasures on the humps of camels,

    to a people that cannot profit them.

For Egypt’s help is worthless and empty,

    therefore I have called her

    “Rahab who sits still.”

And now, go, write it before them on a tablet,

    and inscribe it in a book,

that it may be for the time to come

    as a witness for ever.

For they are a rebellious people,

    lying sons,

sons who will not hear

    the instruction of the Lord;

who say to the seers, “See not”;

    and to the prophets, “Prophesy not to us what is right;

speak to us smooth things,

    prophesy illusions,

leave the way, turn aside from the path,

    let us hear no more of the Holy One of Israel.”

Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,

“Because you despise this word,

    and trust in oppression and perverseness,

    and rely on them;

therefore this iniquity shall be to you

    like a break in a high wall, bulging out, and about to collapse,

    whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant;

and its breaking is like that of a potter’s vessel

    which is smashed so ruthlessly

that among its fragments not a sherd is found

    with which to take fire from the hearth,

    or to dip up water out of the cistern.”

For thus said the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel,

    “In returning and rest you shall be saved;

    in quietness and in trust shall be your strength.”

And you would not, but you said,

“No! We will speed upon horses,”

    therefore you shall speed away;

and, “We will ride upon swift steeds,”

    therefore your pursuers shall be swift.

A thousand shall flee at the threat of one,

    at the threat of five you shall flee,

till you are left

    like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain,

    like a signal on a hill.

Therefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you;

    therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you.

For the Lord is a God of justice;

    blessed are all those who wait for him.
