### Hosea 9:1-14

### A prediction of exile and sterility

Rejoice not, O Israel!

Exult not like the peoples;

for you have played the harlot, forsaking your God.

    You have loved a harlot’s hire

    upon all threshing floors.

Threshing floor and winevat shall not feed them,

    and the new wine shall fail them.

They shall not remain in the land of the Lord;

    but Eʹphraim shall return to Egypt,

    and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.

They shall not pour libations of wine to the Lord;

    and they shall not please him with their sacrifices.

Their bread shall be like mourners’ bread;

    all who eat of it shall be defiled;

for their bread shall be for their hunger only;

    it shall not come to the house of the Lord.

What will you do on the day of appointed festival,

    and on the day of the feast of the Lord?

For behold, they are going to Assyria;

    Egypt shall gather them,

    Memphis shall bury them.

Nettles shall possess their precious things of silver;

    thorns shall be in their tents.

The days of punishment have come,

    the days of recompense have come;

    Israel shall know it.

The prophet is a fool,

    the man of the spirit is mad,

because of your great iniquity

    and great hatred.

The prophet is the watchman of Eʹphraim,

    the people of my God,

yet a fowler’s snare is on all his ways,

    and hatred in the house of his God.

They have deeply corrupted themselves

    as in the days of Gibʹe-ah:

he will remember their iniquity,

    he will punish their sins.

Like grapes in the wilderness,

    I found Israel.

Like the first fruit on the fig tree,

    in its first season,

    I saw your fathers.

But they came to Baʹal-peʹor,

    and consecrated themselves to Baʹal,

    and became detestable like the thing they loved.

Eʹphraim’s glory shall fly away like a bird—

    no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!

Even if they bring up children,

    I will bereave them till none is left.

Woe to them

    when I depart from them!

Eʹphraim’s sons, as I have seen, are destined for a prey;

    Eʹphraim must lead forth his sons to slaughter.

Give them, O Lord—

    what wilt thou give?

Give them a miscarrying womb

    and dry breasts.
