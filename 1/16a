### Absalom’s rebellion and David’s flight

At the end of four years Abʹsalom said to the king, “Pray let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the Lord, in Hebron. For your servant vowed a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the Lord.’” The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose, and went to Hebron. But Abʹsalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, ‘Abʹsalom is king at Hebron!’” With Abʹsalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their simplicity, and knew nothing. And while Abʹsalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithʹophel the Giʹlonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Abʹsalom kept increasing.

And a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Abʹsalom.” Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee; or else there will be no escape for us from Abʹsalom; go in haste, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.”

    And Abiʹathar came up, and lo, Zadok came also, with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God, until the people had all passed out of the city. Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his habitation; but if he says, ‘I have no pleasure in you,’ behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.” The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Look, go back to the city in peace, you and Abiʹathar, with your two sons, Ahimʹa-az your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiʹathar. See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.” So Zadok and Abiʹathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they remained there.

    But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered; and all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went.

    When King David came to Bahuʹrim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimʹe-i, the son of Gera; and as he came he cursed continually. And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. And Shimʹe-i said as he cursed, “Begone, begone, you man of blood, you worthless fellow! The Lord has avenged upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Abʹsalom. See, your ruin is on you; for you are a man of blood.”

    Then Abiʹshai the son of Zeruʹiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.” But the king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruʹiah? If he is cursing because the Lord has said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’” And David said to Abiʹshai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord has bidden him. It may be that the Lord will look upon my affliction, and that the Lord will repay me with good for this cursing of me today.” So David and his men went on the road, while Shimʹe-i went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him and flung dust.
