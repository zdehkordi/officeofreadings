## Friday of week 25 in Ordinary Time

### Isaiah 28:1-6,14-22

### An oracle against Samaria and leaders of Judah

Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Eʹphraim,

    and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,

    which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome with wine!

Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong;

    like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest,

like a storm of mighty, overflowing waters,

    he will cast down to the earth with violence.

The proud crown of the drunkards of Eʹphraim

    will be trodden under foot;

and the fading flower of its glorious beauty,

    which is on the head of the rich valley,

will be like a first-ripe fig before the summer:

    when a man sees it, he eats it up

    as soon as it is in his hand.

In that day the Lord of hosts will be a crown of glory,

    and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people;

and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,

    and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers,

    who rule this people in Jerusalem!

Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,

    and with Sheol we have an agreement;

when the overwhelming scourge passes through

    it will not come to us;

for we have made lies our refuge,

    and in falsehood we have taken shelter”;

therefore thus says the Lord God,

“Behold, I am laying in Zion for a foundation

    a stone, a tested stone,

a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation:

    ‘He who believes will not be in haste.’

And I will make justice the line,

    and righteousness the plummet;

and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,

    and waters will overwhelm the shelter.”

Then your covenant with death will be annulled,

    and your agreement with Sheol will not stand;

when the overwhelming scourge passes through

    you will be beaten down by it.

As often as it passes through it will take you;

    for morning by morning it will pass through,

    by day and by night;

and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.

For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it,

    and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in it.

For the Lord will rise up as on Mount Peraʹzim,

    he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon;

to do his deed—strange is his deed!

    and to work his work—alien is his work!

Now therefore do not scoff,

    lest your bonds be made strong;

for I have heard a decree of destruction

    from the Lord God of hosts upon the whole land.
