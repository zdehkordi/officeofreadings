### Gideon conquers with a smaller army

All the Midʹianites and the Amalʹekites and the people of the East came together, and crossing the Jordan they encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. But the Spirit of the Lord took possession of Gideon; and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezʹrites were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers throughout all Manasʹseh; and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebʹulun, and Naphʹtali; and they went up to meet them.

Then Jerubbaʹal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midʹian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

    The Lord said to Gideon, “The people with you are too many for me to give the Midʹianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, ‘My own hand has delivered me.’ Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home.’” And Gideon tested them; twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained.

    And the Lord said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; take them down to the water and I will test them for you there; and he of whom I say to you, ‘This man shall go with you,’ shall go with you; and any of whom I say to you, ‘This man shall not go with you,’ shall not go.” So he brought the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gideon, “Every one that laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself; likewise every one that kneels down to drink.” And the number of those that lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water. And the Lord said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Midʹianites into your hand; and let all the others go every man to his home.” So he took the jars of the people from their hands, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midʹian was below him in the valley.

    And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars. And he said to them, “Look at me, and do likewise; when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For the Lord and for Gideon.’”

    So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. And the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!” They stood every man in his place round about the camp, and all the army ran; they cried out and fled. When they blew the three hundred trumpets, the Lord set every man’s sword against his fellow and against all the army.
