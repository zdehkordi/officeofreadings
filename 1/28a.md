## 28th Sunday in Ordinary Time

### Zephaniah 3:8-20

### Salvation is promised to Israel’s poor

“Therefore wait for me,” says the Lord,

    “for the day when I arise as a witness.

For my decision is to gather nations,

    to assemble kingdoms,

to pour out upon them my indignation,

    all the heat of my anger;

for in the fire of my jealous wrath

    all the earth shall be consumed.

“Yea, at that time I will change the speech of the peoples

    to a pure speech,

that all of them may call on the name of the Lord

    and serve him with one accord.

From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia

    my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed ones,

    shall bring my offering.

“On that day you shall not be put to shame

    because of the deeds by which you have rebelled against me;

for then I will remove from your midst

    your proudly exultant ones,

and you shall no longer be haughty

    in my holy mountain.

For I will leave in the midst of you

    a people humble and lowly.

They shall seek refuge in the name of the Lord,

    those who are left in Israel;

they shall do no wrong

    and utter no lies,

nor shall there be found in their mouth

    a deceitful tongue.

For they shall pasture and lie down,

    and none shall make them afraid.”

Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;

    shout, O Israel!

Rejoice and exult with all your heart,

    O daughter of Jerusalem!

The Lord has taken away the judgments against you,

    he has cast out your enemies.

The King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst;

    you shall fear evil no more.

On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:

“Do not fear, O Zion;

    let not your hands grow weak.

The Lord your God is in your midst,

    a warrior who gives victory;

he will rejoice over you with gladness,

    he will renew you in his love;

he will exult over you with loud singing

    as on a day of festival.

“I will remove disaster from you,

    so that you will not bear reproach for it.

Behold, at that time I will deal

    with all your oppressors.

And I will save the lame

    and gather the outcast,

and I will change their shame into praise

    and renown in all the earth.

At that time I will bring you home,

    at the time when I gather you together;

yea, I will make you renowned and praised

    among all the peoples of the earth,

when I restore your fortunes

    before your eyes,” says the Lord.
