### God’s plan for the evil King Ahab

For three years Syria and Israel continued without war. But in the third year Jehoshʹaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Raʹmoth-gilʹead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?” And he said to Jehoshʹaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Raʹmoth-gilʹead?” And Jehoshʹaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”

    And Jehoshʹaphat said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the word of the Lord.” Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Raʹmoth-gilʹead, or shall I forbear?” And they said, “Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” But Jehoshʹaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of the Lord of whom we may inquire?” And the king of Israel said to Jehoshʹaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, Micaiʹah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil.” And Jehoshʹaphat said, “Let not the king say so.” Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiʹah the son of Imlah.” And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiʹah, shall we go to Raʹmoth-gilʹead to battle, or shall we forbear?” And he answered him, “Go up and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” But the king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?” And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the Lord said, ‘These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.’” And the king of Israel said to Jehoshʹaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” And Micaiʹah said, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left; and the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Raʹmoth-gilʹead?’ And one said one thing, and another said another. Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying, ‘I will entice him.’ And the Lord said to him, ‘By what means?’ And he said, ‘I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.’ Now therefore behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the Lord has spoken evil concerning you.”

So the king of Israel and Jehoshʹaphat the king of Judah went up to Raʹmoth-gilʹead. But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot. And about sunset a cry went through the army, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”

    So the king died, and was brought to Samarʹia; and they buried the king in Samarʹia. And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samarʹia, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken.
