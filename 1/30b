### Jeremiah 25:15-17,27-38

### The chalice of God’s wrath against the pagans

Thus the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword which I am sending among them.”

    So I took the cup from the Lord’s hand, and made all the nations to whom the Lord sent me drink it: 

    “Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, be drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I am sending among you.’

    “And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: You must drink! For behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, says the Lord of hosts.’

    “You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them:

‘The Lord will roar from on high,

    and from his holy habitation utter his voice;

he will roar mightily against his fold,

    and shout, like those who tread grapes,

    against all the inhabitants of the earth.

The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth,

    for the Lord has an indictment against the nations;

he is entering into judgment with all flesh,

    and the wicked he will put to the sword,

    says the Lord.’

“Thus says the Lord of hosts:

Behold, evil is going forth

    from nation to nation,

and a great tempest is stirring

    from the farthest parts of the earth!

“And those slain by the Lord on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.

“Wail, you shepherds, and cry,

    and roll in ashes, you lords of the flock,

for the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come,

    and you shall fall like choice rams.

No refuge will remain for the shepherds,

    nor escape for the lords of the flock.

Hark, the cry of the shepherds,

    and the wail of the lords of the flock!

For the Lord is despoiling their pasture,

    and the peaceful folds are devastated,

    because of the fierce anger of the Lord.

Like a lion he has left his covert,

    for their land has become a waste

because of the sword of the oppressor,

    and because of his fierce anger.”
