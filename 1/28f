## Thursday of week 28 in Ordinary Time

### Jeremiah 4:5-8,13-28

### The destroyer will come from the North

Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say,

“Blow the trumpet through the land;

    cry aloud and say,

‘Assemble, and let us go

    into the fortified cities!’

Raise a standard toward Zion,

    flee for safety, stay not,

for I bring evil from the north,

    and great destruction.

A lion has gone up from his thicket,

    a destroyer of nations has set out;

    he has gone forth from his place

to make your land a waste;

    your cities will be ruins

    without inhabitant.

For this gird you with sackcloth,

    lament and wail;

for the fierce anger of the Lord

    has not turned back from us.”

Behold, he comes up like clouds,

    his chariots like the whirlwind;

his horses are swifter than eagles—

    woe to us, for we are ruined!

O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness,

    that you may be saved.

How long shall your evil thoughts

    lodge within you?

For a voice declares from Dan

    and proclaims evil from Mount Eʹphraim.

Warn the nations that he is coming;

    announce to Jerusalem,

“Besiegers come from a distant land;

    they shout against the cities of Judah.

Like keepers of a field are they against her round about,

    because she has rebelled against me,

    says the Lord.

Your ways and your doings

    have brought this upon you.

This is your doom, and it is bitter;

    it has reached your very heart.”

My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain!

    Oh, the walls of my heart!

My heart is beating wildly;

    I cannot keep silent;

for I hear the sound of the trumpet,

    the alarm of war.

Disaster follows hard on disaster,

    the whole land is laid waste.

Suddenly my tents are destroyed,

    my curtains in a moment.

How long must I see the standard,

    and hear the sound of the trumpet?

“For my people are foolish,

    they know me not;

they are stupid children,

    they have no understanding.

They are skilled in doing evil,

    but how to do good they know not.”

I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void;

    and to the heavens, and they had no light.

I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking,

    and all the hills moved to and fro.

I looked, and lo, there was no man,

    and all the birds of the air had fled.

I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert,

    and all its cities were laid in ruins

    before the Lord, before his fierce anger.

For thus says the Lord, “The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.

For this the earth shall mourn,

    and the heavens above be black;

for I have spoken, I have purposed;

    I have not relented nor will I turn back.”
