### Isaiah 22:1-14

### Against Israel’s false securities

The oracle concerning the valley of vision.

What do you mean that you have gone up,

    all of you, to the housetops,

you who are full of shoutings,

    tumultuous city, exultant town?

Your slain are not slain with the sword

    or dead in battle.

All your rulers have fled together,

    without the bow they were captured.

All of you who were found were captured,

    though they had fled far away.

Therefore I said:

“Look away from me,

    let me weep bitter tears;

do not labor to comfort me

    for the destruction of the daughter of my people.”

For the Lord God of hosts has a day

    of tumult and trampling and confusion

    in the valley of vision,

a battering down of walls

    and a shouting to the mountains.

And Elam bore the quiver

    with chariots and horsemen,

    and Kir uncovered the shield.

Your choicest valleys were full of chariots,

    and the horsemen took their stand at the gates.

He has taken away the covering of Judah.

In that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest, and you saw that the breaches of the city of David were many, and you collected the waters of the lower pool, and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or have regard for him who planned it long ago.

In that day the Lord God of hosts

    called to weeping and mourning,

    to baldness and girding with sackcloth;

and behold, joy and gladness,

    slaying oxen and killing sheep,

    eating flesh and drinking wine.

“Let us eat and drink,

    for tomorrow we die.”

The Lord of hosts has revealed himself in my ears:

“Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you

    till you die,”

    says the Lord God of hosts.
