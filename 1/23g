## Saturday of week 23 in Ordinary Time

### Hosea 5:15-7:2

### The futility of false conversion

In their distress they seek me, saying,

“Come, let us return to the Lord;

for he has torn, that he may heal us;

    he has stricken, and he will bind us up.

After two days he will revive us;

    on the third day he will raise us up,

    that we may live before him.

Let us know, let us press on to know the Lord;

    his going forth is sure as the dawn;

he will come to us as the showers,

    as the spring rains that water the earth.”

What shall I do with you, O Eʹphraim?

    What shall I do with you, O Judah?

Your love is like a morning cloud,

    like the dew that goes early away.

Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets,

    I have slain them by the words of my mouth,

    and my judgment goes forth as the light.

For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,

    the knowledge of God, rather than burnt offerings.

But at Adam they transgressed the covenant;

    there they dealt faithlessly with me.

Gilead is a city of evildoers,

    tracked with blood.

As robbers lie in wait for a man,

    so the priests are banded together;

they murder on the way to Shechem,

    yea, they commit villainy.

In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;

    Eʹphraim’s harlotry is there, Israel is defiled.

For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.

When I would restore the fortunes of my people,

when I would heal Israel,

the corruption of Eʹphraim is revealed,

    and the wicked deeds of Samarʹia;

for they deal falsely,

    the thief breaks in,

    and the bandits raid without.

But they do not consider

    that I remember all their evil works.

Now their deeds encompass them,

    they are before my face.
