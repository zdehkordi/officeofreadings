## Thursday of week 31 in Ordinary Time

### Jeremiah 31:15-22,27-34

### An announcement of salvation and New Covenant

Thus says the Lord:

“A voice is heard in Ramah,

    lamentation and bitter weeping.

Rachel is weeping for her children;

    she refuses to be comforted for her children,

    because they are not.”

Thus says the Lord:

“Keep your voice from weeping,

    and your eyes from tears;

for your work shall be rewarded,

    says the Lord,

    and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.

There is hope for your future,

    says the Lord,

    and your children shall come back to their own country.

I have heard Eʹphraim bemoaning,

‘Thou hast chastened me, and I was chastened,

    like an untrained calf;

bring me back that I may be restored,

    for thou art the Lord my God.

For after I had turned away I repented;

    and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh;

I was ashamed, and I was confounded,

    because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’

Is Eʹphraim my dear son?

    Is he my darling child?

For as often as I speak against him,

    I do remember him still.

Therefore my heart yearns for him;

    I will surely have mercy on him,

    says the Lord.

“Set up waymarks for yourself,

    make yourself guideposts;

consider well the highway,

    the road by which you went.

Return, O virgin Israel,

    return to these your cities.

How long will you waver,

    O faithless daughter?

For the Lord has created a new thing on the earth:

    a woman protects a man.”

“Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast. And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the Lord. In those days they shall no longer say:

‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,

    and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’

But every one shall die for his own sin; each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.

“Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, though I was their husband, says the Lord. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each man teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”
