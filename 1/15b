### 2 Samuel 2:1-11,3:1-5

### David is anointed King of Judah at Hebron

After this David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?” And the Lord said to him, “Go up.” David said, “To which shall I go up?” And he said, “To Hebron.” So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinʹo-am of Jezreʹel, and Abʹigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. And David brought up his men who were with him, every one with his household; and they dwelt in the towns of Hebron. And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.

    When they told David, “It was the men of Jaʹbesh-gilʹead who buried Saul,” David sent messengers to the men of Jaʹbesh-gilʹead, and said to them, “May you be blessed by the Lord, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord, and buried him! Now may the Lord show steadfast love and faithfulness to you! And I will do good to you because you have done this thing. Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”

Now Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-boʹsheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaʹim; and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashʹurites and Jezreʹel and Eʹphraim and Benjamin and all Israel. Ish-boʹsheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.

    And sons were born to David at Hebron: his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinʹo-am of Jezreʹel; and his second, Chilʹe-ab, of Abʹigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Abʹsalom the son of Maʹacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; and the fourth, Adoniʹjah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiʹah the son of Abiʹtal; and the sixth, Ithʹre-am, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
