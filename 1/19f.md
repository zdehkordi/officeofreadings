### 2 Kings 9:1-16,22-27

### Jehu is anointed king of Israel by a disciple of Elisha

Eliʹsha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Raʹmoth-gilʹead. And when you arrive, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshʹaphat, son of Nimshi; and go in and bid him rise from among his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber. Then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord, I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and flee; do not tarry.”

    So the young man, the prophet, went to Raʹmoth-gilʹead. And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council; and he said, “I have an errand to you, O commander.” And Jehu said, “To which of us all?” And he said, “To you, O commander.” So he arose, and went into the house; and the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, “Thus says the Lord the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel. And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge on Jezʹebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord. For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel. And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baʹasha the son of Ahiʹjah. And the dogs shall eat Jezʹebel in the territory of Jezreʹel, and none shall bury her.” Then he opened the door, and fled.

    When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the fellow and his talk.” And they said, “That is not true; tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord, I anoint you king over Israel.’ ” Then in haste every man of them took his garment, and put it under him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, “Jehu is king.”

Thus Jehu the son of Jehoshʹaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Raʹmoth-gilʹead against Hazʹael king of Syria; but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreʹel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazʹael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, “If this is your mind, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreʹel.” Then Jehu mounted his chariot, and went to Jezreʹel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziʹah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.

    And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” He answered, “What peace can there be, so long as the harlotries and the sorceries of your mother Jezʹebel are so many?” Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziʹah, “Treachery, O Ahaziʹah!” And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank in his chariot. Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, “Take him up, and cast him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreʹelite; for remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how the Lord uttered this oracle against him: ‘As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons—says the Lord—I will requite you on this plot of ground.’ Now therefore take him up and cast him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the Lord.”

When Ahaziʹah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him, and said, “Shoot him also”; and they shot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megidʹdo, and died there.
