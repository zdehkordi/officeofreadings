### Hezekiah’s prayer. Jerusalem’s salvation

Eliʹakim the son of Hilkiʹah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joʹah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiʹah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of the Rabʹshakeh.

When King Hezekiʹah heard it, he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. And he sent Eliʹakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiʹah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth. It may be that the Lord your God heard all the words of the Rabʹshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.” When the servants of King Hezekiʹah came to Isaiah, Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me. Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’ ”

The Rabʹshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he heard that the king had left Lachish. And when the king heard concerning Tirhaʹkah king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has set out to fight against you,” he sent messengers again to Hezekiʹah, saying, “Thus shall you speak to Hezekiʹah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered? Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations which my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaʹim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’ ”

Hezekiʹah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiʹah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord. And Hezekiʹah prayed before the Lord, and said: “O Lord the God of Israel, who art enthroned above the cherubim, thou art the God, thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear; open thy eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear the words of Sennachʹerib, which he has sent to mock the living God. Of a truth, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they were destroyed. So now, O Lord our God, save us, I beseech thee, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou, O Lord, art God alone.”

And that night the angel of the Lord went forth, and slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. Then Sennachʹerib king of Assyria departed, and went home, and dwelt at Ninʹeveh. And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adramʹmelech and Shareʹzer, his sons, slew him with the sword, and escaped into the land of Arʹarat. And Esarhadʹdon his son reigned in his stead.
