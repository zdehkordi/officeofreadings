### Ezekiel 28:1-19

### An oracle against the proud city of Tyre

The word of the Lord came to me: “Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord God:

“Because your heart is proud,

    and you have said, ‘I am a god,

I sit in the seat of the gods,

    in the heart of the seas,’

yet you are but a man, and no god,

    though you consider yourself as wise as a god—

you are indeed wiser than Daniel;

    no secret is hidden from you;

by your wisdom and your understanding

    you have gotten wealth for yourself,

and have gathered gold and silver

    into your treasuries;

by your great wisdom in trade

    you have increased your wealth,

    and your heart has become proud in your wealth—

therefore thus says the Lord God:

“Because you consider yourself

    as wise as a god,

therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon you,

    the most terrible of the nations;

and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom

    and defile your splendor.

They shall thrust you down into the Pit,

    and you shall die the death of the slain

    in the heart of the seas.

Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’

    in the presence of those who slay you,

though you are but a man, and no god,

    in the hands of those who wound you?

You shall die the death of the uncircumcised

    by the hand of foreigners;

    for I have spoken, says the Lord God.”

Moreover the word of the Lord came to me: “Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord God:

“You were the signet of perfection,

    full of wisdom

    and perfect in beauty.

You were in Eden, the garden of God;

    every precious stone was your covering,

carnelian, topaz, and jasper,

    chrysolite, beryl, and onyx,

sapphire, carbuncle, and emerald;

    and wrought in gold were your settings

    and your engravings.

On the day that you were created

    they were prepared.

With an anointed guardian cherub I placed you;

    you were on the holy mountain of God;

    in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.

You were blameless in your ways

    from the day you were created,

    till iniquity was found in you.

In the abundance of your trade

    you were filled with violence, and you sinned;

so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God,

    and the guardian cherub drove you out

    from the midst of the stones of fire.

Your heart was proud because of your beauty;

    you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor.

I cast you to the ground;

    I exposed you before kings,

    to feast their eyes on you.

By the multitude of your iniquities,

    in the unrighteousness of your trade

    you profaned your sanctuaries;

so I brought forth fire from the midst of you;

    it consumed you,

and I turned you to ashes upon the earth

    in the sight of all who saw you.

All who know you among the peoples

    are appalled at you;

you have come to a dreadful end

    and shall be no more for ever.”
