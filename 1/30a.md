### Jeremiah 23:9-17,21-29

### Against false prophets

My heart is broken within me,

    all my bones shake;

I am like a drunken man,

    like a man overcome by wine,

because of the Lord

    and because of his holy words.

For the land is full of adulterers;

    because of the curse the land mourns,

    and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.

Their course is evil,

    and their might is not right.

“Both prophet and priest are ungodly;

    even in my house I have found their wickedness,

    says the Lord.

Therefore their way shall be to them

    like slippery paths in the darkness,

    into which they shall be driven and fall;

for I will bring evil upon them

    in the year of their punishment,

    says the Lord.

In the prophets of Samarʹia

    I saw an unsavory thing:

they prophesied by Baʹal

    and led my people Israel astray.

But in the prophets of Jerusalem

    I have seen a horrible thing:

they commit adultery and walk in lies;

    they strengthen the hands of evildoers,

    so that no one turns from his wickedness;

all of them have become like Sodom to me,

    and its inhabitants like Gomorʹrah.”

Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets:

“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,

    and give them poisoned water to drink;

for from the prophets of Jerusalem

    ungodliness has gone forth into all the land.”

Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes; they speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord. They say continually to those who despise the word of the Lord, ‘It shall be well with you’; and to every one who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, ‘No evil shall come upon you.’ ”

“I did not send the prophets,

    yet they ran;

I did not speak to them,

    yet they prophesied.

But if they had stood in my council,

    then they would have proclaimed my words to my people,

and they would have turned them from their evil way,

    and from the evil of their doings.

“Am I a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? says the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord. I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart, who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams which they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baʹal? Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? says the Lord. Is not my word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer which breaks the rock in pieces?
