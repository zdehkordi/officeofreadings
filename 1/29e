## Friday of week 29 in Ordinary Time

### Jeremiah 22:10-30

### Oracles against the last kings of Judah

Weep not for him who is dead,

    nor bemoan him;

but weep bitterly for him who goes away,

    for he shall return no more

    to see his native land.

For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiʹah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiʹah his father, and who went away from this place: “He shall return here no more, but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again.”

“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,

    and his upper rooms by injustice;

who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing,

    and does not give him his wages;

who says, ‘I will build myself a great house

    with spacious upper rooms,’

and cuts out windows for it,

    paneling it with cedar,

    and painting it with vermilion.

Do you think you are a king

    because you compete in cedar?

Did not your father eat and drink

    and do justice and righteousness?

    Then it was well with him.

He judged the cause of the poor and needy;

    then it was well.

Is not this to know me?

    says the Lord.

But you have eyes and heart

    only for your dishonest gain,

for shedding innocent blood,

    and for practicing oppression and violence.”

Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiʹakim the son of Josiʹah, king of Judah:

“They shall not lament for him, saying,

    ‘Ah my brother!’ or ‘Ah sister!’

They shall not lament for him, saying,

    ‘Ah lord!’ or ‘Ah his majesty!’

With the burial of an ass he shall be buried,

    dragged and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”

“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,

    and lift up your voice in Bashan;

cry from Abʹarim,

    for all your lovers are destroyed.

I spoke to you in your prosperity,

    but you said, ‘I will not listen.’

This has been your way from your youth,

    that you have not obeyed my voice.

The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,

    and your lovers shall go into captivity;

then you will be ashamed and confounded

    because of all your wickedness.

O inhabitant of Lebanon,

    nested among the cedars,

how you will groan when pangs come upon you,

    pain as of a woman in travail!”

“As I live, says the Lord, though Coniʹah the son of Jehoiʹakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezʹzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeʹans. I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die. But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.”

Is this man Coniʹah a despised, broken pot,

    a vessel no one cares for?

Why are he and his children hurled and cast

    into a land which they do not know?

O land, land, land,

    hear the word of the Lord!

Thus says the Lord:

“Write this man down as childless,

    a man who shall not succeed in his days;

for none of his offspring shall succeed

    in sitting on the throne of David,

    and ruling again in Judah.”
