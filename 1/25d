### Isaiah 7:1-17

### In fear of war, the sign of Emmanuel

In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziʹah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliʹah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could not conquer it. When the house of David was told, “Syria is in league with Eʹphraim,” his heart and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.

    And the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go forth to meet Ahaz, you and Sheʹar-jashʹub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller’s Field, and say to him, ‘Take heed, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliʹah. Because Syria, with Eʹphraim and the son of Remaliʹah, has devised evil against you, saying, “Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Taʹbe-el as king in the midst of it,” thus says the Lord God:

It shall not stand,

    and it shall not come to pass.

For the head of Syria is Damascus,

    and the head of Damascus is Rezin.

(Within sixty-five years Eʹphraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.)

And the head of Eʹphraim is Samarʹia,

    and the head of Samarʹia is the son of Remaliʹah.

If you will not believe,

    surely you shall not be established.’”

Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, “Ask a sign of the Lord your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.” And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, a young woman shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanʹu-el. He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted. The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father’s house such days as have not come since the day that Eʹphraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria.”
