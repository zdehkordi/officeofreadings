### 2 Kings 13:10-25

### The reign of Jehoash in Israel. Prophet Elisha’s death

In the thirty-seventh year of Joʹash king of Judah Jehoʹash the son of Jehoʹahaz began to reign over Israel in Samarʹia, and he reigned sixteen years. He also did what was evil in the sight of the Lord; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, but he walked in them. Now the rest of the acts of Joʹash, and all that he did, and the might with which he fought against Amaziʹah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? So Joʹash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboʹam sat upon his throne; and Joʹash was buried in Samarʹia with the kings of Israel.

Now when Eliʹsha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joʹash king of Israel went down to him, and wept before him, crying, “My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And Eliʹsha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows”; so he took a bow and arrows. Then he said to the king of Israel, “Draw the bow”; and he drew it. And Eliʹsha laid his hands upon the king’s hands. And he said, “Open the window eastward”; and he opened it. Then Eliʹsha said, “Shoot”; and he shot. And he said, “The Lord’s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! For you shall fight the Syrians in Aphek until you have made an end of them.” And he said, “Take the arrows”; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground with them”; and he struck three times, and stopped. Then the man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only three times.”

    So Eliʹsha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year. And as a man was being buried, lo, a marauding band was seen and the man was cast into the grave of Eliʹsha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Eliʹsha, he revived, and stood on his feet.

Now Hazʹael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoʹahaz. But the Lord was gracious to them and had compassion on them, and he turned toward them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them; nor has he cast them from his presence until now.

    When Hazʹael king of Syria died, Ben-haʹdad his son became king in his stead. Then Jehoʹash the son of Jehoʹahaz took again from Ben-haʹdad the son of Hazʹael the cities which he had taken from Jehoʹahaz his father in war. Three times Joʹash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
