### God’s people struggle to appoint a king

The men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand of Midʹian.” Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the Lord will rule over you.” Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives. And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimʹelech. And Gideon the son of Joʹash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joʹash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiezʹrites.

Now Abimʹelech the son of Jerubbaʹal went to Shechem to his mother’s kinsmen and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother’s family, “Say in the ears of all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaʹal rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.” And his mother’s kinsmen spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the men of Shechem; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimʹelech, for they said, “He is our brother.” And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baʹal-beʹrith with which Abimʹelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him. And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaʹal, seventy men, upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaʹal was left, for he hid himself. And all the citizens of Shechem came together, and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimʹelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.

When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Geriʹzim, and cried aloud and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you. The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’ But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my fatness, by which gods and men are honored, and go to sway over the trees?’ And the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’ But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to sway over the trees?’ And the trees said to the vine, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’ But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I leave my wine which cheers gods and men, and go to sway over the trees?’ Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’ And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’

    “If you then have acted in good faith and honor with Jerubbaʹal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimʹelech, and let him also rejoice in you; but if not, let fire come out from Abimʹelech, and devour the citizens of Shechem, and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the citizens of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimʹelech.”
