## Friday of week 24 in Ordinary Time

### Hosea 14:2-10

### A call to conversion and promise of safety

Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God,

    for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.

Take with you words

    and return to the Lord;

say to him,

    “Take away all iniquity;

accept that which is good

    and we will render

    the fruit of our lips.

Assyria shall not save us,

    we will not ride upon horses;

and we will say no more, ‘Our God,’

    to the work of our hands.

In thee the orphan finds mercy.”

I will heal their faithlessness;

    I will love them freely,

    for my anger has turned from them.

I will be as the dew to Israel;

    he shall blossom as the lily,

    he shall strike root as the poplar;

his shoots shall spread out;

    his beauty shall be like the olive,

    and his fragrance like Lebanon.

They shall return and dwell beneath my shadow,

    they shall flourish as a garden;

they shall blossom as the vine,

    their fragrance shall be like the wine of Lebanon.

O Eʹphraim, what have I to do with idols?

    It is I who answer and look after you.

I am like an evergreen cypress,

    from me comes your fruit.

Whoever is wise, let him understand these things;

    whoever is discerning, let him know them;

for the ways of the Lord are right,

    and the upright walk in them,

    but transgressors stumble in them.
