### 2 Chronicles 35:20-36:12

### The corruption of Judah, and the first captivity

After all this, when Josiʹah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carʹchemish on the Euphraʹtes and Josiʹah went out against him. But he sent envoys to him, saying, “What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you.” Nevertheless Josiʹah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megidʹdo. And the archers shot King Josiʹah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.” So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiʹah. Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiʹah; and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiʹah in their laments to this day. They made these an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments. Now the rest of the acts of Josiʹah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the law of the Lord, and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

The people of the land took Jehoʹahaz the son of Josiʹah and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem. Jehoʹahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid upon the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. And the king of Egypt made Eliʹakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiʹakim; but Neco took Jehoʹahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt.

Jehoiʹakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. Against him came up Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon. Nebuchadnezʹzar also carried part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiʹakim, and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiʹachin his son reigned in his stead.

Jehoiʹachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezʹzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made his brother Zedekiʹah king over Judah and Jerusalem.

Zedekiʹah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the Lord.
