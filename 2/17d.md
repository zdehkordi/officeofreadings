### Job 32:1-6,33:1-22

### Elihu speaks on the mystery of God

Job’s three friends ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. Then Eliʹhu the son of Barʹachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God; he was angry also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong. Now Eliʹhu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he. And when Eliʹhu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he became angry.

    And Eliʹhu the son of Barʹachel the Buzite answered:

“I am young in years,

    and you are aged;

therefore I was timid and afraid

    to declare my opinion to you.

“But now, hear my speech, O Job,

    and listen to all my words.

Behold, I open my mouth;

    the tongue in my mouth speaks.

My words declare the uprightness of my heart,

    and what my lips know they speak sincerely.

The spirit of God has made me,

    and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

Answer me, if you can;

    set your words in order before me; take your stand.

Behold, I am toward God as you are;

    I too was formed from a piece of clay.

Behold, no fear of me need terrify you;

    my pressure will not be heavy upon you.

“Surely, you have spoken in my hearing,

    and I have heard the sound of your words.

You say, ‘I am clean, without transgression;

    I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.

Behold, he finds occasions against me,

    he counts me as his enemy;

he puts my feet in the stocks,

    and watches all my paths.’

“Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you.

    God is greater than man.

Why do you contend against him,

    saying, ‘He will answer none of my words’?

For God speaks in one way,

    and in two, though man does not perceive it.

In a dream, in a vision of the night,

    when deep sleep falls upon men,

    while they slumber on their beds,

then he opens the ears of men,

    and terrifies them with warnings,

that he may turn man aside from his deed,

    and cut off pride from man;

he keeps back his soul from the Pit,

    his life from perishing by the sword.

“Man is also chastened with pain upon his bed,

    and with continual strife in his bones;

so that his life loathes bread,

    and his appetite dainty food.

His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen;

    and his bones which were not seen stick out.

His soul draws near the Pit,

    and his life to those who bring death.”
