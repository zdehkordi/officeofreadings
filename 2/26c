### Judith 6:1-8,10-7:1,4-5

### Achior is handed over to the sons of Israel

When the disturbance made by the men outside the council died down, Holoferʹnes, the commander of the Assyrian army, said to Achʹior and all the Moʹabites in the presence of all the foreign contingents:

    “And who are you, Achʹior, and you hirelings of Eʹphraim, to prophesy among us as you have done today and tell us not to make war against the people of Israel because their God will defend them? Who is God except Nebuchadnezʹzar? He will send his forces and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God will not deliver them—we the king’s servants will destroy them as one man. They cannot resist the might of our cavalry. We will burn them up, and their mountains will be drunk with their blood, and their fields will be full of their dead. They cannot withstand us, but will utterly perish. So says King Nebuchadnezʹzar, the lord of the whole earth. For he has spoken; none of his words shall be in vain.

    “But you, Achʹior, you Amʹmonite hireling, who have said these words on the day of your iniquity, you shall not see my face again from this day until I take revenge on this race that came out of Egypt. Then the sword of my army and the spear of my servants shall pierce your sides, and you shall fall among their wounded, when I return. Now my slaves are going to take you back into the hill country and put you in one of the cities beside the passes, and you will not die until you perish along with them.”

    Then Holoferʹnes ordered his slaves, who waited on him in his tent, to seize Achʹior and take him to Bethuʹlia and hand him over to the men of Israel. So the slaves took him and led him out of the camp into the plain, and from the plain they went up into the hill country and came to the springs below Bethuʹlia. When the men of the city saw them, they caught up their weapons and ran out of the city to the top of the hill, and all the slingers kept them from coming up by casting stones at them. However, they got under the shelter of the hill and they bound Achʹior and left him lying at the foot of the hill, and returned to their master.

    Then the men of Israel came down from their city and found him; and they untied him and brought him into Bethuʹlia and placed him before the magistrates of their city, who in those days were Uzziʹah the son of Micah, of the tribe of Simʹeon, and Chabris the son of Gothonʹiel, and Charmis the son of Melʹchiel. They called together all the elders of the city, and all their young men and their women ran to the assembly; and they set Achʹior in the midst of all their people, and Uzziʹah asked him what had happened. He answered and told them what had taken place at the council of Holoferʹnes, and all that he had said in the presence of the Assyrian leaders, and all that Holoferʹnes had said so boastfully against the house of Israel. Then the people fell down and worshiped God, and cried out to him, and said,

    “O Lord God of heaven, behold their arrogance, and have pity on the humiliation of our people, and look this day upon the faces of those who are consecrated to thee.”

    Then they consoled Achʹior, and praised him greatly. And Uzziʹah took him from the assembly to his own house and gave a banquet for the elders; and all that night they called on the God of Israel for help.

    The next day Holoferʹnes ordered his whole army, and all the allies who had joined him, to break camp and move against Bethuʹlia, and to seize the passes up into the hill country and make war on the Israelites. When the Israelites saw their vast numbers they were greatly terrified, and every one said to his neighbor, “These men will now lick up the face of the whole land; neither the high mountains nor the valleys nor the hills will bear their weight.” Then each man took up his weapons, and when they had kindled fires on their towers they remained on guard all that night.
