## 29th Sunday in Ordinary Time

### Ecclesiasticus 26:1-4,12-23

### The good woman and the bad woman

Happy is the husband of a good wife;

    the number of his days will be doubled.

A loyal wife rejoices her husband,

    and he will complete his years in peace.

A good wife is a great blessing;

    she will be granted among the blessings of the man who fears the Lord.

Whether rich or poor, his heart is glad,

    and at all times his face is cheerful.

A wife’s harlotry shows in her lustful eyes,

    and she is known by her eyelids.

Keep strict watch over a headstrong daughter,

    lest, when she finds liberty, she use it to her hurt.

Be on guard against her impudent eye,

    and do not wonder if she sins against you.

As a thirsty wayfarer opens his mouth

    and drinks from any water near him,

so will she sit in front of every post

    and open her quiver to the arrow.

A wife’s charm delights her husband,

    and her skill puts fat on his bones.

A silent wife is a gift of the Lord,

    and there is nothing so precious as a disciplined soul.

A modest wife adds charm to charm,

    and no balance can weigh the value of a chaste soul.

Like the sun rising in the heights of the Lord,

    so is the beauty of a good wife in her well-ordered home.

Like the shining lamp on the holy lampstand,

    so is a beautiful face on a stately figure.

Like pillars of gold on a base of silver,

    so are beautiful feet with a steadfast heart.
