### Tobit 4:1-5a,7a,20,5:1-12,16-22

### The young Tobias embarks on a journey

On that day Tobit remembered the money which he had left in trust with Gabʹael at Rages in Media, and he said to himself: “I have asked for death. Why do I not call my son Tobiʹas so that I may explain to him about the money before I die?” So he called him and said, “My son, when I die, bury me, and do not neglect your mother. Honor her all the days of your life; do what is pleasing to her, and do not grieve her. Remember, my son, that she faced many dangers for you while you were yet unborn. When she dies, bury her beside me in the same grave.

    “Remember the Lord our God all your days, my son, and refuse to sin or to transgress his commandments. Give alms from your possessions to all who live uprightly, and do not let your eye begrudge the gift when you make it. 

    “And now let me explain to you about the ten talents of silver which I left in trust with Gabʹael the son of Gabriʹas at Rages in Media.”

    Then Tobiʹas answered him, “Father, I will do everything that you have commanded me; but how can I obtain the money when I do not know the man?” Then Tobit gave him the receipt, and said to him, “Find a man to go with you and I will pay him wages as long as I live; and go and get the money.” So he went to look for a man; and he found Raphʹael, who was an angel, but Tobiʹas did not know it. Tobiʹas said to him, “Can you go with me to Rages in Media? Are you acquainted with that region?” The angel replied, “I will go with you; I am familiar with the way, and I have stayed with our brother Gabʹael.” Then Tobiʹas said to him, “Wait for me, and I shall tell my father.” And he said to him, “Go, and do not delay.” So he went in and said to his father, “I have found some one to go with me.” He said, “Call him to me, so that I may learn to what tribe he belongs, and whether he is a reliable man to go with you.”

    So Tobiʹas invited him in; he entered and they greeted each other. Then Tobit said to him, “My brother, to what tribe and family do you belong? Tell me.” But he answered, “Are you looking for a tribe and a family or for a man whom you will pay to go with your son?” And Tobit said to him, “I should like to know, my brother, your people and your name.” He replied, “I am Azariʹas the son of the great Ananiʹas, one of your relatives.”

    Then he said to Tobiʹas, “Get ready for the journey, and good success to you both.” So his son made the preparations for the journey. And his father said to him, “Go with this man; God who dwells in heaven will prosper your way, and may his angel attend you.” So they both went out and departed, and the young man’s dog was with them.

    But Anna, his mother, began to weep, and said to Tobit, “Why have you sent our child away? Is he not the staff of our hands as he goes in and out before us? Do not add money to money, but consider it as rubbish as compared to our child. For the life that is given to us by the Lord is enough for us.” And Tobit said to her, “Do not worry, my sister; he will return safe and sound, and your eyes will see him. For a good angel will go with him; his journey will be successful, and he will come back safe and sound.”

    So she stopped weeping.
