### Ecclesiasticus 16:24-17:14

### Man, the summit of all creation

Listen to me, my son, and acquire knowledge,

    and pay close attention to my words.

I will impart instruction by weight,

    and declare knowledge accurately.

The works of the Lord have existed from the beginning by his creation,

    and when he made them, he determined their divisions.

He arranged his works in an eternal order,

    and their dominion for all generations;

they neither hunger nor grow weary,

    and they do not cease from their labors.

They do not crowd one another aside,

    and they will never disobey his word.

After this the Lord looked upon the earth,

    and filled it with his good things;

with all kinds of living beings he covered its surface,

    and to it they return.

The Lord created man out of earth,

    and turned him back to it again.

He gave to men few days, a limited time,

    but granted them authority over the things upon the earth.

He endowed them with strength like his own,

    and made them in his own image.

He placed the fear of them in all living beings,

    and granted them dominion over beasts and birds.

He made for them tongue and eyes;

    he gave them ears and a mind for thinking.

He filled them with knowledge and understanding,

    and showed them good and evil.

He set his eye upon their hearts

    to show them the majesty of his works.

And they will praise his holy name,

    to proclaim the grandeur of his works.

He bestowed knowledge upon them,

    and allotted to them the law of life.

He established with them an eternal covenant,

    and showed them his judgments.

Their eyes saw his glorious majesty,

    and their ears heard the glory of his voice.

And he said to them, “Beware of all unrighteousness.”

    And he gave commandment to each of them concerning his neighbor.
