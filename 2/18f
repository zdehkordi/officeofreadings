## Thursday of week 18 in Ordinary Time

### Joel 4:9-21

### Eternal happiness after judgement

Proclaim this among the nations:

Prepare war,

    stir up the mighty men.

Let all the men of war draw near,

    let them come up.

Beat your plowshares into swords,

    and your pruning hooks into spears;

    let the weak say, “I am a warrior.”

Hasten and come,

    all you nations round about,

    gather yourselves there.

Bring down thy warriors, O Lord.

Let the nations bestir themselves,

    and come up to the valley of Jehoshʹaphat;

for there I will sit to judge

    all the nations round about.

Put in the sickle,

    for the harvest is ripe.

Go in, tread,

    for the wine press is full.

The vats overflow,

    for their wickedness is great.

Multitudes, multitudes,

    in the valley of decision!

For the day of the Lord is near

    in the valley of decision.

The sun and the moon are darkened,

    and the stars withdraw their shining.

And the Lord roars from Zion,

    and utters his voice from Jerusalem,

    and the heavens and the earth shake.

But the Lord is a refuge to his people,

    a stronghold to the people of Israel.

“So you shall know that I am the Lord your God,

    who dwell in Zion, my holy mountain.

And Jerusalem shall be holy

    and strangers shall never again pass through it.

“And in that day

the mountains shall drip sweet wine,

    and the hills shall flow with milk,

and all the stream beds of Judah

    shall flow with water;

and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord

    and water the valley of Shittim.

“Egypt shall become a desolation

    and Edom a desolate wilderness,

for the violence done to the people of Judah,

    because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

But Judah shall be inhabited for ever,

    and Jerusalem to all generations.

I will avenge their blood, and I will not clear the guilty,

    for the Lord dwells in Zion.”
