## Wednesday of week 27 in Ordinary Time

### Ecclesiasticus 3:17-4:10

### Humility and arrogance

My son, perform your tasks in meekness;

    then you will be loved by those whom God accepts.

The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself;

    so you will find favor in the sight of the Lord.

For great is the might of the Lord;

    he is glorified by the humble.

Seek not what is too difficult for you,

    nor investigate what is beyond your power.

Reflect upon what has been assigned to you,

    for you do not need what is hidden.

Do not meddle in what is beyond your tasks,

    for matters too great for human understanding have been shown you.

For their hasty judgment has led many astray,

    and wrong opinion has caused their thoughts to slip.

If you have no eyes you will be without light;

    if you lack knowledge do not profess to have it.

A stubborn mind will be afflicted at the end,

    and whoever loves danger will perish by it.

A stubborn mind will be burdened by troubles,

    and the sinner will heap sin upon sin.

The affliction of the proud has no healing,

    for a plant of wickedness has taken root in him.

The mind of the intelligent man will ponder a parable,

    and an attentive ear is the wise man’s desire.

Water extinguishes a blazing fire:

    so almsgiving atones for sin.

Whoever requites favors gives thought to the future;

    at the moment of his falling he will find support.

My son, deprive not the poor of his living,

    and do not keep needy eyes waiting.

Do not grieve the one who is hungry,

    nor anger a man in want.

Do not add to the troubles of an angry mind,

    nor delay your gift to a beggar.

Do not reject an afflicted suppliant,

    nor turn your face away from the poor.

Do not avert your eye from the needy,

    nor give a man occasion to curse you;

for if in bitterness of soul he calls down a curse upon you,

    his Creator will hear his prayer.

Make yourself beloved in the congregation;

    bow your head low to a great man.

Incline your ear to the poor,

    and answer him peaceably and gently.

Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of the wrongdoer;

    and do not be fainthearted in judging a case.

Be like a father to orphans,

    and instead of a husband to their mother;

you will then be like a son of the Most High,

    and he will love you more than does your mother.
