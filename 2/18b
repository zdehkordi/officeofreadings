## Monday of week 18 in Ordinary Time

### Joel 1:1,13-2:11

### A sign of the approaching Day of the Lord

The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuʹel:

Gird on sackcloth and lament, O priests,

    wail, O ministers of the altar.

Go in, pass the night in sackcloth,

    O ministers of my God!

Because cereal offering and drink offering

    are withheld from the house of your God.

Sanctify a fast,

    call a solemn assembly.

Gather the elders

    and all the inhabitants of the land

to the house of the Lord your God;

    and cry to the Lord.

Alas for the day!

For the day of the Lord is near,

    and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.

Is not the food cut off

    before our eyes,

joy and gladness

    from the house of our God?

The seed shrivels under the clods,

    the storehouses are desolate;

the granaries are ruined

    because the grain has failed.

How the beasts groan!

    The herds of cattle are perplexed

because there is no pasture for them;

    even the flocks of sheep are dismayed.

Unto thee, O Lord, I cry.

For fire has devoured

    the pastures of the wilderness,

and flame has burned

    all the trees of the field.

Even the wild beasts cry to thee

    because the water brooks are dried up,

and fire has devoured

    the pastures of the wilderness.

Blow the trumpet in Zion;

sound the alarm on my holy mountain!

Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,

    for the day of the Lord is coming, it is near,

a day of darkness and gloom,

    a day of clouds and thick darkness!

Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains

    a great and powerful people;

their like has never been from of old,

    nor will be again after them

    through the years of all generations.

Fire devours before them,

    and behind them a flame burns.

The land is like the garden of Eden before them,

    but after them a desolate wilderness,

    and nothing escapes them.

Their appearance is like the appearance of horses,

    and like war horses they run.

As with the rumbling of chariots,

    they leap on the tops of the mountains,

like the crackling of a flame of fire

    devouring the stubble,

like a powerful army

    drawn up for battle.

Before them peoples are in anguish,

    all faces grow pale.

Like warriors they charge,

    like soldiers they scale the wall.

They march each on his way,

    they do not swerve from their paths.

They do not jostle one another,

    each marches in his path;

they burst through the weapons

    and are not halted.

They leap upon the city,

    they run upon the walls;

they climb up into the houses,

    they enter through the windows like a thief.

The earth quakes before them,

    the heavens tremble.

The sun and the moon are darkened,

    and the stars withdraw their shining.

The Lord utters his voice

    before his army,

for his host is exceedingly great;

    he that executes his word is powerful.

For the day of the Lord is great and very terrible;

    who can endure it?
