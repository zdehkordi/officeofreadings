## Wednesday of week 28 in Ordinary Time

### Ecclesiasticus 15:11-20

### Human freedom

Do not say, “Because of the Lord I left the right way”;

    for he will not do what he hates.

Do not say, “It was he who led me astray”;

    for he had no need of a sinful man.

The Lord hates all abominations,

    and they are not loved by those who fear him.

It was he who created man in the beginning,

    and he left him in the power of his own inclination.

If you will, you can keep the commandments,

    and to act faithfully is a matter of your own choice.

He has placed before you fire and water:

    stretch out your hand for whichever you wish.

Before a man are life and death,

    and whichever he chooses will be given to him.

For great is the wisdom of the Lord;

    he is mighty in power and sees everything;

his eyes are on those who fear him,

    and he knows every deed of man.

He has not commanded any one to be ungodly,

    and he has not given any one permission to sin.
