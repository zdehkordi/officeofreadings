## Tuesday of week 17 in Ordinary Time

### Job 31:1-8,13-23,35-37

### Job’s former righteousness

Job again took up his discourse, and said:

“I have made a covenant with my eyes;

    how then could I look upon a virgin?

What would be my portion from God above,

    and my heritage from the Almighty on high?

Does not calamity befall the unrighteous,

    and disaster the workers of iniquity?

Does not he see my ways,

    and number all my steps?

“If I have walked with falsehood,

    and my foot has hastened to deceit;

(Let me be weighed in a just balance,

    and let God know my integrity!)

if my step has turned aside from the way,

    and my heart has gone after my eyes,

    and if any spot has cleaved to my hands;

then let me sow, and another eat;

    and let what grows for me be rooted out.

“If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant,

    when they brought a complaint against me;

what then shall I do when God rises up?

    When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?

Did not he who made me in the womb make him?

    And did not one fashion us in the womb?

“If I have withheld anything that the poor desired,

    or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

or have eaten my morsel alone,

    and the fatherless has not eaten of it

(for from his youth I reared him as a father,

    and from his mother’s womb I guided him);

if I have seen any one perish for lack of clothing,

    or a poor man without covering;

if his loins have not blessed me,

    and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

if I have raised my hand against the fatherless,

    because I saw help in the gate;

then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder,

    and let my arm be broken from its socket.

For I was in terror of calamity from God,

    and I could not have faced his majesty.

Oh, that I had one to hear me!

    (Here is my signature! let the Almighty answer me!)

    Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!

Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;

    I would bind it on me as a crown;

I would give him an account of all my steps;

    like a prince I would approach him.”
