### Tobias 7:1,8b-14,8:4-16

### Tobias marries Sarah

When they reached Ecbatʹana and arrived at the house of Ragʹuel, Sarah met them and greeted them. They returned her greeting, and she brought them into the house.

    Then Tobiʹas said to Raphʹael, “Brother Azariʹas, speak of those things which you talked about on the journey, and let the matter be settled.” So he communicated the proposal to Ragʹuel. And Ragʹuel said to Tobiʹas, “Eat, drink, and be merry; for it is your right to take my child. But let me explain the true situation to you. I have given my daughter to seven husbands, and when each came to her he died in the night. But for the present be merry.” And Tobiʹas said, “I will eat nothing here until you make a binding agreement with me.” So Ragʹuel said, “Take her right now, in accordance with the law. You are her relative, and she is yours. The merciful God will guide you both for the best.” Then he called his daughter Sarah, and taking her by the hand he gave her to Tobiʹas to be his wife, saying, “Here she is; take her according to the law of Moses, and take her with you to your father.” And he blessed them. Next he called his wife Edna, and took a scroll and wrote out the contract; and they set their seals to it. Then they began to eat.

    And Ragʹuel called his wife Edna and said to her, “Sister, make up the other room, and take her into it.” So she did as he said, and took her there; and the girl began to weep. But the mother comforted her daughter in her tears, and said to her, “Be brave, my child; the Lord of heaven and earth grant you joyb in place of this sorrow of yours. Be brave, my daughter.”

    When the door was shut and the two were alone, Tobiʹas got up from the bed and said, “Sister, get up, and let us pray that the Lord may have mercy upon us.” And Tobiʹas began to pray,

“Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers,

    and blessed be thy holy and glorious name for ever.

    Let the heavens and all thy creatures bless thee.

Thou madest Adam and gavest him Eve his wife

    as a helper and support.

    From them the race of mankind has sprung.

Thou didst say, ‘It is not good that the man should be alone;

    let us make a helper for him like himself.’

And now, O Lord, I am not taking this sister of mine because of lust, but with sincerity. Grant that I may find mercy and may grow old together with her.” And she said with him, “Amen.” Then they both went to sleep for the night.

    But Ragʹuel arose and went and dug a grave, with the thought, “Perhaps he too will die.” Then Ragʹuel went into his house and said to his wife Edna, “Send one of the maids to see whether he is alive; and if he is not, let us bury him without any one knowing about it.” So the maid opened the door and went in, and found them both asleep. And she came out and told them that he was alive. Then Ragʹuel blessed God and said,

“Blessed art thou, O God, with every pure and holy blessing.

    Let thy saints and all thy creatures bless thee;

    let all thy angels and thy chosen people bless thee for ever.

Blessed art thou, because thou hast made me glad.

    It has not happened to me as I expected;

    but thou hast treated us according to thy great mercy.”
