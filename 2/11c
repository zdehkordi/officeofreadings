### Ezra 4:1-5,24-5:5

### Resistance to the rebuilding of the Temple

Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the Lord, the God of Israel, they approached Zerubʹbabel and the heads of fathers’ houses and said to them, “Let us build with you; for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of Eʹsar-hadʹdon king of Assyria who brought us here.” But Zerubʹbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ houses in Israel said to them, “You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the Lord, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”

    Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and made them afraid to build, and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Dariʹus king of Persia.

    Then the work on the house of God which is in Jerusalem stopped; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Dariʹus king of Persia.

Now the prophets, Hagʹgai and Zechariʹah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. Then Zerubʹbabel the son of She-alʹti-el and Jeshua the son of Joʹzadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.

    At the same time Tatʹtenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Sheʹthar-bozʹenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?” They also asked them this, “What are the names of the men who are building this building?” But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them till a report should reach Dariʹus and then answer be returned by letter concerning it.
