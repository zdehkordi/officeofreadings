## Monday of week 29 in Ordinary Time

### Ecclesiasticus 27:22-28:7

### Against anger and vengeance

Whoever winks his eye plans evil deeds,

    and no one can keep him from them.

In your presence his mouth is all sweetness,

    and he admires your words;

but later he will twist his speech

    and with your own words he will give offense.

I have hated many things, but none to be compared to him;

    even the Lord will hate him.

Whoever throws a stone straight up throws it on his own head;

    and a treacherous blow opens up wounds.

He who digs a pit will fall into it,

    and he who sets a snare will be caught in it.

If a man does evil, it will roll back upon him,

    and he will not know where it came from.

Mockery and abuse issue from the proud man,

    but vengeance lies in wait for him like a lion.

Those who rejoice in the fall of the godly will be caught in a snare,

    and pain will consume them before their death.

Anger and wrath, these also are abominations,

    and the sinful man will possess them.

He that takes vengeance will suffer vengeance from the Lord,

    and he will firmly establish his sins.

Forgive your neighbor the wrong he has done,

    and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.

Does a man harbor anger against another,

    and yet seek for healing from the Lord?

Does he have no mercy toward a man like himself,

    and yet pray for his own sins?

If he himself, being flesh, maintains wrath,

    who will make expiation for his sins?

Remember the end of your life, and cease from enmity,

    remember destruction and death, and be true to the commandments.

Remember the commandments, and do not be angry with your neighbor;

    remember the covenant of the Most High, and overlook ignorance.
