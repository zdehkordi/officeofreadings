### Mattathias’ rebellion and death

In those days Mattathiʹas the son of John, son of Simʹeon, a priest of the sons of Joʹarib, moved from Jerusalem and settled in Moʹde-in. 

    Then the king’s officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the city of Moʹde-in to make them offer sacrifice. Many from Israel came to them; and Mattathiʹas and his sons were assembled. Then the king’s officers spoke to Mattathiʹas as follows: “You are a leader, honored and great in this city, and supported by sons and brothers. Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah and those that are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”

    But Mattathiʹas answered and said in a loud voice: “Even if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him, and have chosen to do his commandments, departing each one from the religion of his fathers, yet I and my sons and my brothers will live by the covenant of our fathers. Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances. We will not obey the king’s words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left.”

    When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice upon the altar in Moʹde-in, according to the king’s command. When Mattathiʹas saw it, he burned with zeal and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and killed him upon the altar. At the same time he killed the king’s officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar. Thus he burned with zeal for the law, as Phinʹehas did against Zimri the son of Salu.

    Then Mattathiʹas cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: “Let every one who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!” And he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the city.

Then there united with them a company of Hasideʹans, mighty warriors of Israel, every one who offered himself willingly for the law. And all who became fugitives to escape their troubles joined them and reinforced them. They organized an army, and struck down sinners in their anger and lawless men in their wrath; the survivors fled to the Gentiles for safety. And Mattathiʹas and his friends went about and tore down the altars; they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel. They hunted down the arrogant men, and the work prospered in their hands. They rescued the law out of the hands of the Gentiles and kings, and they never let the sinner gain the upper hand.

Now the days drew near for Mattathiʹas to die, and he said to his sons: “Arrogance and reproach have now become strong; it is a time of ruin and furious anger. Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our fathers.

    “Now behold, I know that Simʹeon your brother is wise in counsel; always listen to him; he shall be your father. Judas Maccabeʹus has been a mighty warrior from his youth; he shall command the army for you and fight the battle against the peoples. You shall rally about you all who observe the law, and avenge the wrong done to your people. Pay back the Gentiles in full, and heed what the law commands.”

    Then he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers. He died in the one hundred and forty-sixth year and was buried in the tomb of his fathers at Moʹde-in. And all Israel mourned for him with great lamentation.
