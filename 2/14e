## Friday of week 14 in Ordinary Time

### Proverbs 15:8-9,16-17,25-26,29,33,16:1-9,17:5

### Man’s position before God

The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,

    but the prayer of the upright is his delight.

The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,

    but he loves him who pursues righteousness.

Better is a little with the fear of the Lord

    than great treasure and trouble with it.

Better is a dinner of herbs where love is

    than a fatted ox and hatred with it.

The Lord tears down the house of the proud,

    but maintains the widow’s boundaries.

The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,

    the words of the pure are pleasing to him.

The Lord is far from the wicked,

    but he hears the prayer of the righteous.

The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom,

    and humility goes before honor.

The plans of the mind belong to man,

    but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.

All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,

    but the Lord weighs the spirit.

Commit your work to the Lord,

    and your plans will be established.

The Lord has made everything for its purpose,

    even the wicked for the day of trouble.

Every one who is arrogant is an abomination to the Lord;

    be assured, he will not go unpunished.

By loyalty and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for,

    and by the fear of the Lord a man avoids evil.

When a man’s ways please the Lord,

    he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.

Better is a little with righteousness

    than great revenues with injustice.

A man’s mind plans his way,

    but the Lord directs his steps.

He who mocks the poor insults his Maker;

    he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished.
