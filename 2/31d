## Wednesday of week 31 in Ordinary Time

### Wisdom 11:21-12:2,11-19

### God’s mercy and patience

Who can withstand the might of thy arm?

Because the whole world before thee is like a speck that tips the scales,

and like a drop of morning dew that falls upon the ground.

But thou art merciful to all, for thou canst do all things,

and thou dost overlook men’s sins, that they may repent.

For thou lovest all things that exist,

and hast loathing for none of the things which thou hast made,

for thou wouldst not have made anything if thou hadst hated it.

How would anything have endured if thou hadst not willed it?

Or how would anything not called forth by thee have been preserved?

Thou sparest all things, for they are thine, O Lord who lovest the living.

For thy immortal spirit is in all things.

Therefore thou dost correct little by little those who trespass,

and dost remind and warn them of the things wherein they sin,

that they may be freed from wickedness and put their trust in thee, O Lord.

For they were an accursed race from the beginning,

and it was not through fear of any one that thou didst leave them unpunished for their sins.

For who will say, “What hast thou done?”

Or will resist thy judgment?

Who will accuse thee for the destruction of nations which thou didst make?

Or who will come before thee to plead as an advocate for unrighteous men?

For neither is there any god besides thee, whose care is for all men,

to whom thou shouldst prove that thou hast not judged unjustly;

nor can any king or monarch confront thee about those whom thou hast punished.

Thou art righteous and rulest all things righteously,

deeming it alien to thy power

to condemn him who does not deserve to be punished.

For thy strength is the source of righteousness,

and thy sovereignty over all causes thee to spare all.

For thou dost show thy strength when men doubt the completeness of thy power,

and dost rebuke any insolence among those who know it.

Thou who art sovereign in strength dost judge with mildness,

and with great forbearance thou dost govern us;

for thou hast power to act whenever thou dost choose.

Through such works thou has taught thy people

that the righteous man must be kind,

and thou hast filled thy sons with good hope,

because thou givest repentance for sins.
