### Proverbs 1:1-7,20-33

### An exhortation to seek wisdom

The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

That men may know wisdom and instruction,

    understand words of insight,

receive instruction in wise dealing,

    righteousness, justice, and equity;

that prudence may be given to the simple,

    knowledge and discretion to the youth—

the wise man also may hear and increase in learning,

    and the man of understanding acquire skill,

to understand a proverb and a figure,

    the words of the wise and their riddles.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;

    fools despise wisdom and instruction.

Wisdom cries aloud in the street;

    in the markets she raises her voice;

on the top of the walls she cries out;

    at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:

“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?

How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing

    and fools hate knowledge?

Give heed to my reproof;

behold, I will pour out my thoughts to you;

    I will make my words known to you.

Because I have called and you refused to listen,

    have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,

and you have ignored all my counsel

    and would have none of my reproof,

I also will laugh at your calamity;

    I will mock when panic strikes you,

when panic strikes you like a storm,

    and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,

    when distress and anguish come upon you.

Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;

    they will seek me diligently but will not find me.

Because they hated knowledge

    and did not choose the fear of the Lord,

would have none of my counsel,

    and despised all my reproof,

therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way

    and be sated with their own devices.

For the simple are killed by their turning away,

    and the complacence of fools destroys them;

but he who listens to me will dwell secure

    and will be at ease, without dread of evil.”
