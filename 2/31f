### Wisdom 13:1-10,14:15-21,15:1-6

### A wise man rejects idols

All men who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature;

and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know him who exists,

nor did they recognize the craftsman while paying heed to his works;

but they supposed that either fire or wind or swift air,

or the circle of the stars, or turbulent water,

or the luminaries of heaven were the gods that rule the world.

If through delight in the beauty of these things men assumed them to be gods,

let them know how much better than these is their Lord,

for the author of beauty created them.

And if men were amazed at their power and working,

let them perceive from them

how much more powerful is he who formed them.

For from the greatness and beauty of created things

comes a corresponding perception of their Creator.

Yet these men are little to be blamed,

for perhaps they go astray

while seeking God and desiring to find him.

For as they live among his works they keep searching,

and they trust in what they see, because the things that are seen are beautiful.

Yet again, not even they are to be excused;

for if they had the power to know so much

that they could investigate the world,

how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things?

But miserable, with their hopes set on dead things, are the men

who give the name “gods” to the works of men’s hands,

gold and silver fashioned with skill,

and likenesses of animals,

or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand.

For a father, consumed with grief at an untimely bereavement,

made an image of his child, who had been suddenly taken from him;

and he now honored as a god what was once a dead human being,

and handed on to his dependents secret rites and initiations.

Then the ungodly custom, grown strong with time, was kept as a law,

and at the command of monarchs graven images were worshiped.

When men could not honor monarchs in their presence, since they lived at a distance,

they imagined their appearance far away,

and made a visible image of the king whom they honored,

so that by their zeal they might flatter the absent one as though present.

Then the ambition of the craftsman impelled

even those who did not know the king to intensify their worship.

For he, perhaps wishing to please his ruler,

skilfully forced the likeness to take more beautiful form,

and the multitude, attracted by the charm of his work,

now regarded as an object of worship the one whom shortly before they had honored as a man.

And this became a hidden trap for mankind,

because men, in bondage to misfortune or to royal authority,

bestowed on objects of stone or wood the name that ought not to be shared.

But thou, our God, art kind and true,

patient, and ruling all things in mercy.

For even if we sin we are thine, knowing thy power;

but we will not sin, because we know that we are accounted thine.

For to know thee is complete righteousness,

and to know thy power is the root of immortality.

For neither has the evil intent of human art misled us,

nor the fruitless toil of painters,

a figure stained with varied colors,

whose appearance arouses yearning in fools,

so that they desire the lifeless form of a dead image.

Lovers of evil things and fit for such objects of hope

are those who either make or desire or worship them.
