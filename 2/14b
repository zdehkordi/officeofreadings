### Proverbs 3:1-20

### How wisdom is found

My son, do not forget my teaching,

but let your heart keep my commandments;

for length of days and years of life

    and abundant welfare will they give you.

Let not loyalty and faithfulness forsake you;

    bind them about your neck,

    write them on the tablet of your heart.

So you will find favor and good repute

    in the sight of God and man.

Trust in the Lord with all your heart,

    and do not rely on your own insight.

In all your ways acknowledge him,

    and he will make straight your paths.

Be not wise in your own eyes;

    fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.

It will be healing to your flesh

    and refreshment to your bones.

Honor the Lord with your substance

    and with the first fruits of all your produce;

then your barns will be filled with plenty,

    and your vats will be bursting with wine.

My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline

    or be weary of his reproof,

for the Lord reproves him whom he loves,

    as a father the son in whom he delights.

Happy is the man who finds wisdom,

    and the man who gets understanding,

for the gain from it is better than gain from silver

    and its profit better than gold.

She is more precious than jewels,

    and nothing you desire can compare with her.

Long life is in her right hand;

    in her left hand are riches and honor.

Her ways are ways of pleasantness,

    and all her paths are peace.

She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her;

    those who hold her fast are called happy.

The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;

    by understanding he established the heavens;

by his knowledge the deeps broke forth,

    and the clouds drop down the dew.
