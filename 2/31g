## Saturday of week 31 in Ordinary Time

### Wisdom 18:1-16,19:4-9

### Passover night and the crossing of the Red Sea

For thy holy ones there was very great light.

Their enemies heard their voices but did not see their forms,

and counted them happy for not having suffered,

and were thankful that thy holy ones, though previously wronged, were doing them no injury;

and they begged their pardon for having been at variance with them.

Therefore thou didst provide a flaming pillar of fire

as a guide for thy people’s unknown journey,

and a harmless sun for their glorious wandering.

For their enemies deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned in darkness,

those who had kept thy sons imprisoned,

through whom the imperishable light of the law was to be given to the world.

When they had resolved to kill the babes of thy holy ones,

and one child had been exposed and rescued,

thou didst in punishment take away a multitude of their children;

and thou didst destroy them all together by a mighty flood.

That night was made known beforehand to our fathers,

so that they might rejoice in sure knowledge of the oaths in which they trusted.

The deliverance of the righteous and the destruction of their enemies

were expected by thy people.

For by the same means by which thou didst punish our enemies

thou didst call us to thyself and glorify us.

For in secret the holy children of good men offered sacrifices,

and with one accord agreed to the divine law,

that the saints would share alike the same things,

both blessings and dangers;

and already they were singing the praises of the fathers.

But the discordant cry of their enemies echoed back,

and their piteous lament for their children was spread abroad.

The slave was punished with the same penalty as the master,

and the common man suffered the same loss as the king;

and they all together, by the one form of death,

had corpses too many to count.

For the living were not sufficient even to bury them,

since in one instant their most valued children had been destroyed.

For though they had disbelieved everything because of their magic arts,

yet, when their first-born were destroyed, they acknowledged thy people to be God’s son.

For while gentle silence enveloped all things,

and night in its swift course was now half gone,

thy all-powerful word leaped from heaven, from the royal throne,

into the midst of the land that was doomed,

a stern warrior carrying the sharp sword of thy authentic command,

and stood and filled all things with death,

and touched heaven while standing on the earth.

For the fate they deserved drew them on to this end,

and made them forget what had happened,

in order that they might fill up the punishment which their torments still lacked,

and that thy people might experience an incredible journey,

but they themselves might meet a strange death.

For the whole creation in its nature was fashioned anew,

complying with thy commands,

that thy children might be kept unharmed.

The cloud was seen overshadowing the camp,

and dry land emerging where water had stood before,

an unhindered way out of the Red Sea,

and a grassy plain out of the raging waves,

where those protected by thy hand passed through as one nation,

after gazing on marvelous wonders.

For they ranged like horses,

and leaped like lambs,

praising thee, O Lord, who didst deliver them.
